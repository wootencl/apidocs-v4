*Available modes of operation: real-time*

The Insurance Prices endpoint allows access to our collection of insurance
pricing data. The data comes from private payer data as well as data from
Medicare.

While the endpoint requires a five-digit zip code, only the first three digits
are significant. This is because the index is only granular to the first three
digits of the zip code, commonly called a "geozip" or a "ZIP Code Prefix". These
three digits refer to the geographical regions surrounding major cities or
metropolitan areas. There are approximately 900 "geozips" in the United States.

The submitted amount is the dollar amount the provider submitted to the payer in the insurance claim. The paid amount is the dollar amount that was reimbursed to the provider. |
