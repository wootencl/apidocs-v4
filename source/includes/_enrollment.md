## Benefits Enrollment

*Available modes of operation: batch/async only*

The PokitDok Benefits Enrollment API eases the creation and transmission process
of benefits enrollment and maintenance files. Applications can use the Enrollment
endpoint to submit new enrollments, enrollment changes due to life events and
plan termination. These files are submitted asynchronously via batch mode.

File transmission is performed depending on carrier and group requirements. The
Benefits Enrollment API can be utilized for all enrollment requirements
including open enrollment and is able to support both full and change files.

workflow](https://platform.pokitdok.com/benefit-enrollment).
