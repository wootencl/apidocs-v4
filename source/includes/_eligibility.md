*Available modes of operation: batch/async or real-time*

The Eligibility Endpoint makes it easy to verify a member's insurance information in real-time. You can check
co-insurance, copay, deductible and out of pocket amounts for a member along with other benefit information.

Use the [Trading Partners](#trading-partners) Endpoint to determine available trading_partner_id values for use with the
Eligibility API.

Endpoint | HTTP Method | Description
-------- | ----------- | -----------
/eligibility/ | POST | Determine eligibility via an X12 270 Request For Eligibility


All eligibility requests must include a valid Provider NPI. Some trading partners require that the submitting provider’s
NPI be registered or be a participating provider with that health plan to successfully check eligibility.
When a request is made without a provider name and NPI, the PokitDok NPI and organization name will default in. It is
important to note that the PokitDok NPI may not be accepted by all trading partners.

The PokitDok Eligibility Endpoint allows you to request eligibility for specific service types. The service_type parameter
allows you to specify which particular service(s) you want to check eligibility for. If no service type is specified, the
request will be made for general health benefits (health_benefit_plan_coverage). Please note that some trading partners may
not support specific service type inquiries. A full listing of possible service_types values is included [below](#service-type).
You can also request eligibility information for a specific CPT code, however not all trading partners support such requests.

The /eligibility/ endpoint accepts the following parameters:

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
cpt_code | The CPT code that should be used to request specific eligibility information. Note: requests based on CPT code are not supported by all trading partners.
member.birth_date | The named insured’s birth date as specified on their policy. May be omitted if member.id is provided.
member.first_name | The named insured’s first name as specified on their policy.
member.id | The named insured’s member identifier. May be omitted if member.birth_date is provided.
member.last_name | The named insured’s last name as specified on their policy.
member.group_number | The named insured's group number as specified on their policy.
provider.first_name | The provider’s first name when the provider is an individual.
provider.last_name | The provider’s last name when the provider is an individual.
provider.npi | The NPI for the provider.
provider.organization_name | The provider’s name when the provider is an organization. first_name and last_name should be omitted when sending organization_name.
service_types | The service type(s) the eligibility request is being made against. A full listing of possible service_types values is included [below](#service-type).
trading_partner_id | Unique id for the intended trading partner, as specified by the [Trading Partners](#trading-partners) Endpoint.


Eligibility and benefit responses vary depending on the trading partner and the plan a member is enrolled in. Some plans
may not provide deductible/out-of-pocket, copayment/coinsurance or other specific plan information. PokitDok will provide
all the information provided by the trading partner in the eligibility response.

The /eligibility/ response contains the following parameters:
