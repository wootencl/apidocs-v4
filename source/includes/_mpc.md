The Medical Procedure Code endpoints provide access to clinical and consumer
friendly information related to medical procedures. It's useful for identifying
the procedure code (or codes) that match search queries. It can also be used
for determining the official descriptions for a specific procedure code.

Available Medical Procedure Code Endpoints:

| Endpoint    | HTTP Method | Description                                                                 |
|:------------|:------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /mpc/       | GET         | Get a list of medical procedure information meeting certain search criteria |
| /mpc/{code} | GET         | Retrieve the data for a specific procedure code                             |

The /mpc/ endpoint accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter   | Type     | Description                                                                      |

| description | {string} | A partial or full description to be used to locate medical procedure information |

The /mpc/ response contains the following fields:

| Field       | Type     | Description                                        |
