# Activities
*Available modes of operation: real-time*

Long-running operations are performed asynchronously. Upon initiating those operations via an API endpoint, activity 
tracking information is returned to the caller, which can be used to query the status of the activity later on. 
Throughout processing, activities may transition through the following states:

* init - The activity is initializing
* queued - The activity is in queue waiting to start/resume
* scheduled - The activity is scheduled for the next available transmission to the trading partner
* generating - The activity is generating X12 transactions
* processing - The activity is processing X12 transactions that have been received
* transmitting - The activity is transmitting X12 transactions to trading partner
* waiting - The activity is waiting on a trading partner Response
* receiving - The activity is receiving X12 transactions from a trading partner
* paused - The activity is paused
* notifying - The activity is notifying the client application about activity results
* stored - The activity has stored uploaded batch transactions for later processing
* canceled - The activity was canceled by the client application
* failed - The activity was unable to process successfully
* Information concerning the activity’s progression through the system is available via the API Dashboard, as well as the endpoints listed below.

Available Activity Endpoints:

Endpoint | HTTP Method | Description
-------- | ----------- | -----------
/activities/ | GET | List current activities A query string parameter ‘parent_id’ may also be used with this API to get information about sub-activities that were initiated from a batch file upload.
/activities/{id} | GET | Return detailed information about the specified activity. API applications will receive an activity ID in the API response for all operations that are asynchronous.
/activities/{id} | PUT | Updates an existing activity -- useful for canceling pending activities that a client application no longer wishes to execute
 
The /activities/ response includes the following fields:

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
callback_url | {string} | URL that will be invoked to notify the client application that this Activity has completed. You should always use https for callback URLs used by your application.
history | {array} | Historical status of the progress of this Activity
id | {string} | ID of this Activity
name | {string} | Activity name
parameters | {dict} | The parameters that were originally supplied to the activity
remaining_transitions | {array} | The list of remaining state transitions that the activity has yet to go through
state | {dict} | Current state of this Activity
transition_path | {array} | The list of state transitions that will be used for this Activity
units_of_work | {int} | The number of 'units of work' that the activity is operating on. This will typically be 1 for real-time requests like /eligibility/. When uploading batch X12 files via the /files/ endpoint, this will be the number of ‘transactions’ within that file. For example, if a client application POSTs a file of 20 eligibility requests to the /files/ API, the units_of_work value for that activity will be 20 after the X12 file has been analyzed. If an activity does show a value greater than 1 for units_of_work, the client application can fetch detailed information about each one of the activities processing those units of work by using the /activities/?parent_id=<activity_id> API
